In fact, statistics show that there are more than 10 motor vehicle-related deaths per day in California alone, many of the common causes of collisions are preventable. Significant percentage of the motorists are underinsured or no auto insurance or commercial truck insurance at all.\n\nRoad accidents occur for a variety of reasons. Often, drivers are distracted while behind the wheel, taking their focus away from the road. In other cases, drivers can become tired after spending multiple hours at the wheel, resulting in preventable errors.\n\nSometimes, accidents occur for a combination of reasons, from bad visibility to unsafe road design, or other drivers lack caution. While the causes of accidents can vary, the consequences are often the same, resulting in everything from vehicular and property damage to serious injuries."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Measures to solve the Problem"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "1.

Studying these types of maps help city planners understand which features are most crucial for road safety, and which areas are in highest need of improvement, and may help direct local law enforcement to better serve their communities."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "2.Ridesharing and GPS app analysis."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Ridesharing services like Uber and Lyft are commonly used, as are GPS and apps like Google Maps.

Public transportation optimization."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "About 74 percent of Americans support public transportation spending, but only 5 percent of Americans actually use public transit. Why is this? Most people realize the advantages of a public transportation system, but factors like perceived quality, availability, and efficiency are preventing them from actually using it. In turn, low usage numbers prevent cities from investing more heavily in public transit. It\u2019s a vicious cycle, but one that may be solvable thanks to gathering more data on how public transportation is used (and could be improved). Better routes, more efficient vehicles, and greater accessibility are just the beginning."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "4.

This data will help engineers create even safer autonomous vehicle designs, and create a responsive network where individual vehicles can \u201ctalk\u201d to one another, and exchange information about their environments.

For example, recent research from the World Resources Institute found that there\u2019s a \u201csweet spot\u201d for lane width and safety. Conventional wisdom would say that wider lanes are automatically safer, since vehicles have more room, but the opposite is true; generally, narrow lanes result in fewer collisions."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
